# MySQL Study Journey - Programming with Mosh

Welcome to my repository where I document my learning journey through MySQL, based on the tutorials provided by Mosh Hamedani from the **Programming with Mosh** YouTube channel.

This repo will contain notes, code snippets, and insights that I gain while studying MySQL through Moshâ€™s content. My goal is to master MySQL and gain a deep understanding of relational databases, from basic queries to advanced concepts.

## Learning Goals:
- Learn how to interact with MySQL databases.
- Understand the concepts of relational database design.
- Master SQL queries, joins, indexing, and optimization.
- Learn how to integrate MySQL with various programming languages and frameworks.

## Resources:
The following YouTube tutorials by Mosh Hamedani are my primary source of learning:

- Additional resources from the **Programming with Mosh** channel.

## Repo Structure:
This repository will be organized as follows:

- **Notes/**: A folder where I will document key concepts and learning points.
- **Code Snippets/**: A folder where I will share code examples and SQL queries that I've written or modified.
- **Projects/**: A collection of small MySQL projects and exercises to solidify my learning.
